    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup curry powder, or to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul none>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>
            Gather the ingredients.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add onion and sauté until soft and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>
                Slowly stir in curry powder until well blended.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 4</strong>
            <p>
                Add chicken; reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 5</strong>
            <p>
                Uncover and cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until pan juices reduce to desired amount, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </p>
